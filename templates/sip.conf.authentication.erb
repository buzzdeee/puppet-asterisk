[authentication]
; Global credentials for outbound calls, i.e. when a proxy challenges your
; Asterisk server for authentication. These credentials override
; any credentials in peer/register definition if realm is matched.
;
; This way, Asterisk can authenticate for outbound calls to other
; realms. We match realm on the proxy challenge and pick an set of
; credentials from this list
; Syntax:
;        auth = <user>:<secret>@<realm>
;        auth = <user>#<md5secret>@<realm>
; Example:
;auth=mark:topsecret@digium.com
;
; You may also add auth= statements to [peer] definitions
; Peer auth= override all other authentication settings if we match on realm
