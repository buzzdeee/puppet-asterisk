;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; DEVICE CONFIGURATION
;
; SIP entities have a 'type' which determines their roles within Asterisk.
; * For entities with 'type=peer':
;   Peers handle both inbound and outbound calls and are matched by ip/port, so for
;   The case of incoming calls from the peer, the IP address must match in order for
;   The invitation to work. This means calls made from either direction won't work if
;   The peer is unregistered while host=dynamic or if the host is otherise not set to
;   the correct IP of the sender.
; * For entities with 'type=user':
;   Asterisk users handle inbound calls only (meaning they call Asterisk, Asterisk can't
;   call them) and are matched by their authorization information (authname and secret).
;   Asterisk doesn't rely on their IP and will accept calls regardless of the host setting
;   as long as the incoming SIP invite authorizes successfully.
; * For entities with 'type=friend':
;   Asterisk will create the entity as both a friend and a peer. Asterisk will accept
;   calls from friends like it would for users, requiring only that the authorization
;   matches rather than the IP address. Since it is also a peer, a friend entity can
;   be called as long as its IP is known to Asterisk. In the case of host=dynamic,
;   this means it is necessary for the entity to register before Asterisk can call it.
; 
; Use remotesecret for outbound authentication, and secret for authenticating
; inbound requests. For historical reasons, if no remotesecret is supplied for an
; outbound registration or call, the secret will be used. 
;
; For device names, we recommend using only a-z, numerics (0-9) and underscore
;
; For local phones, type=friend works most of the time
;
; If you have one-way audio, you probably have NAT problems.
; If Asterisk is on a public IP, and the phone is inside of a NAT device
; you will need to configure nat option for those phones.
; Also, turn on qualify=yes to keep the nat session open

; Because you might have a large number of similar sections, it is generally
